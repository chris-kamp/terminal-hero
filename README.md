"Terminal Hero" is a simple turn-based roleplaying game (RPG). Players begin the game by creating a character. In the game, players navigate their character around a world map represented with ASCII art. Different symbols on the map represent different types of terrain and monsters. When the player encounters a monster, this triggers a turn-based combat system in which the player selects actions (such as "attack" or "flee") from a prompt menu. By defeating monsters, the player gains experience to level up their character.
